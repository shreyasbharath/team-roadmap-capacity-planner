# Team Roadmap Capacity Planner - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

Product teams and engineering managers struggle with **visual roadmap planning** that balances high-level strategic initiatives with practical team capacity constraints. Current solutions are either too simplistic (static documents) or overly complex enterprise tools that require significant setup and training.

**Why this matters:**
- Teams waste hours manually creating and updating roadmaps in presentation tools
- Capacity planning is often disconnected from actual roadmap visualisation
- Stakeholders need different granularities (quarterly strategy vs sprint execution)
- Traditional project management tools don't provide intuitive visual timeline representations
- Markdown-based documentation doesn't translate well to visual planning artifacts

The problem is especially acute in fast-moving environments, where multiple teams need to coordinate complex feature releases across web, mobile, and infrastructure components while maintaining transparency for stakeholders.

## Success Metrics

**Primary Success Metrics:**
- **Time to Roadmap Creation**: Reduce from 2+ hours (PowerPoint/Figma) to <30 minutes
- **Update Frequency**: Increase from monthly to weekly roadmap updates due to reduced friction
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: 80%+ of stakeholders can understand and interpret roadmaps without explanation
- **Planning Accuracy**: Reduce capacity overcommitment incidents by 50% through visual capacity management

**Usage Metrics:**
- **Daily Active Users**: 10+ users within first month
- **Export Frequency**: 3+ PDF exports per user per week for stakeholder communication
- **Cross-Platform Adoption**: 60%+ usage on desktop app vs web for power users

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Load Performance**: Render 100+ timeline items in <500ms
- **Visual Regression**: Zero timeline positioning bugs in production
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Consistent rendering across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
