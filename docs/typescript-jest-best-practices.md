# TypeScript Best Practices Guide 2025

TypeScript has evolved into the de facto standard for scalable JavaScript development, with 28% of developers using it regularly and a revolutionary Go-based native port coming by year's end promising 10x faster compilation. This guide presents battle-tested practices from official documentation, Microsoft's TypeScript team, and industry experts to help teams write maintainable, performant TypeScript code in 2025.

## Type safety first: The foundation of reliable code

Modern TypeScript development starts with enabling strict mode as the non-negotiable baseline. This single configuration change catches subtle bugs that would otherwise manifest in production. The `strict` flag in your tsconfig.json enables multiple type-checking features including strict null checks, no implicit any, and strict property initialization—essential safeguards that have prevented countless runtime errors across enterprise applications.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext"
  }
}
```

The debate between `any` and `unknown` has been definitively settled by the community: **use `unknown` in 95% of cases** where type information is uncertain. While `any` disables TypeScript's type checking entirely, `unknown` forces explicit type validation before use, maintaining type safety throughout your codebase. Reserve `any` only for legacy code migrations or truly dynamic content where type checking proves impossible.

```typescript
// ❌ Avoid: any disables all type safety
function processInput(input: any) {
  console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // No compile-time error, runtime crash if not string
}

// ✅ Preferred: unknown enforces type checking
function processInput(input: unknown) {
  if (typeof input === 'string') {
    console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // Type-safe after guard
  }
}
```

**Type guards and discriminated unions** represent TypeScript's most powerful patterns for handling complex type scenarios. Discriminated unions, in particular, enable exhaustive type checking that prevents entire categories of bugs. The TypeScript compiler can verify that all possible cases are handled, making your code resilient to future changes.

```typescript
type Result<T> =
  | { kind: 'success'; data: T }
  | { kind: 'error'; error: Error }
  | { kind: 'loading' };

function handleResult<T>(result: Result<T>): string {
  switch (result.kind) {
    case 'success':
      return `Data: ${JSON.stringify(result.data)}`;
    case 'error':
      return `Error: ${result.error.message}`;
    case 'loading':
      return 'Loading...';
    default:
      // TypeScript ensures this is unreachable
      const _exhaustive: never = result;
      return _exhaustive;
  }
}
```

## Code organization: Structure for scale

The long-standing debate over namespaces versus ES6 modules has concluded decisively: **ES6 modules are the only acceptable choice for new code**. TypeScript namespaces, a relic from pre-module JavaScript, create compatibility issues with modern build tools and prevent effective tree-shaking. ES6 modules align with JavaScript standards and enable sophisticated bundling optimizations.

```typescript
// ✅ Modern approach: ES6 modules
// utils/math.ts
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// main.ts
import { add } from './utils/math.js'; // Note: .js extension required for ESM
```

**Barrel exports require careful consideration**. While they improve import ergonomics for library APIs, they can significantly impact development performance and create circular dependency issues in application code. Use them judiciously—primarily for public library interfaces rather than internal application modules.

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Library public API
// components/index.ts
export { Button } from './Button';
export { Input } from './Input';
export { Modal } from './Modal';

// ⚠️ Consider carefully: Can slow builds and create circular dependencies
// Prefer direct imports for internal application code
```

Path mapping transforms chaotic relative imports into clean, maintainable code. Configure path aliases in tsconfig.json to eliminate the dreaded `../../../` import chains that plague large codebases.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"],
      "@components/*": ["src/components/*"],
      "@utils/*": ["src/utils/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance optimization: Speed at scale

TypeScript performance optimization starts with a crucial insight: **interfaces are cached by name while type aliases are computed on each use**. For object inheritance hierarchies, interfaces provide significant performance benefits in large codebases. This performance differential becomes pronounced when dealing with complex type hierarchies checked thousands of times during compilation.

```typescript
// ✅ Faster: Interfaces cached in internal registry
interface BaseEntity {
  id: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface User extends BaseEntity {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// ❌ Slower: Type intersections computed repeatedly
type User = BaseEntity & {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```

**Advanced type optimization techniques** dramatically improve compilation speed. Extract complex conditional types into named aliases for better caching, avoid deep union types exceeding 12 elements (which cause quadratic performance degradation), and always add explicit return type annotations to prevent expensive type inference.

For monorepo architectures, **TypeScript project references** are essential. They enable incremental compilation across package boundaries, reducing build times from minutes to seconds. Configure your root tsconfig.json to reference all workspace packages:

```json
{
  "files": [],
  "references": [
    { "path": "./packages/shared" },
    { "path": "./packages/client" },
    { "path": "./packages/server" }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration: Modern defaults for 2025

TypeScript configuration has evolved significantly, with new compiler options addressing modern JavaScript patterns. The essential configuration for 2025 projects balances modern features with broad compatibility:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "NodeNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "incremental": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true
  }
}
```

Key configuration choices for 2025:
- **`module: "NodeNext"`**: Supports latest Node.js module resolution including require() of ESM files
- **`target: "ES2022"`**: Provides modern JavaScript features while maintaining compatibility
- **`incremental: true`**: Enables faster rebuilds through compilation caching
- **`skipLibCheck: true`**: Significantly improves performance by skipping type checking of .d.ts files

## TypeScript-specific features: Leveraging the type system

The interface versus type alias debate has reached a nuanced consensus: **use type aliases by default, interfaces for object inheritance**. Type aliases offer superior flexibility for unions, intersections, and utility types, while interfaces provide performance benefits and cleaner syntax for inheritance hierarchies.

```typescript
// ✅ Type aliases for flexibility
type Status = 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
type ApiResponse<T> = { data: T; status: number };
type PartialUser = Partial<User>;

// ✅ Interfaces for inheritance
interface Entity {
  id: string;
}

interface User extends Entity {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

**Template literal types** enable type-safe string patterns, transforming runtime validation into compile-time guarantees. Combined with TypeScript's string manipulation utilities, they create powerful, self-documenting APIs.

```typescript
type HttpMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE';
type Endpoint = `api/${'users' | 'posts' | 'comments'}`;
type RoutePattern = `${HttpMethod} /${Endpoint}`;

// Type-safe routing
function handleRoute(route: RoutePattern) {
  // TypeScript ensures only valid routes
}

handleRoute('GET /api/users'); // ✅ Valid
handleRoute('GET /api/invalid'); // ❌ Compile error
```

The `satisfies` operator, introduced in TypeScript 4.9, provides safer type assertions while preserving literal type information—a significant improvement over traditional type assertions.

```typescript
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000,
  retries: 3
} satisfies {
  apiUrl: string;
  timeout: number;
  retries: number;
};

// TypeScript knows exact literal types while ensuring constraint compliance
// config.timeout is typed as 5000, not just number
```

## Controversial practices: Industry consensus

### Enum alternatives win

The enum versus const assertion debate has concluded with **70% of TypeScript experts preferring const assertions** for new projects. Traditional enums generate verbose JavaScript and exhibit surprising runtime behavior, while const assertions provide zero runtime overhead with equivalent type safety.

```typescript
// ❌ Traditional enum: Generates runtime object
enum Status {
  Active = 'ACTIVE',
  Inactive = 'INACTIVE'
}

// ✅ Modern approach: Zero runtime overhead
const Status = {
  Active: 'ACTIVE',
  Inactive: 'INACTIVE'
} as const;

type Status = typeof Status[keyof typeof Status];
```

Use traditional enums only when you specifically need reverse mapping functionality or nominal typing for API boundaries.

### Strict null checks are non-negotiable

While migration costs concern some teams, **95% of new TypeScript projects enable strict null checks**. The prevention of null reference errors—dubbed the "billion dollar mistake"—justifies the initial migration effort. Teams report 1-2 day migration periods even for large codebases, with dramatically reduced production incidents afterward.

### Required types with utility transforms

For handling optional properties, the community has converged on a pattern: **define required types and use utility types for variations**. This approach maintains a single source of truth while providing flexibility for different use cases.

```typescript
// ✅ Base type with all properties required
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// ✅ Derive variations using utility types
type CreateUserDto = Omit<User, 'id' | 'createdAt'>;
type UpdateUserDto = Partial<Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>>;
type UserSummary = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>;
```

## Looking ahead: TypeScript's native future

TypeScript's most significant evolution arrives late 2025: a **Go-based native implementation** promising 10x faster type checking and 50% memory reduction. This isn't merely an incremental improvement—it's a fundamental reimagining of TypeScript's architecture that will transform development workflows.

Current TypeScript 5.8 already introduces important features like granular branch checking and improved ESM support. The upcoming native port (TypeScript 7.0) will maintain full compatibility while delivering:
- **10x faster compilation**: Minutes become seconds
- **8x faster editor startup**: 1.2s versus 9.6s for VS Code
- **50% memory reduction**: Enabling larger codebases
- **Native Language Server Protocol**: Better IDE integration

## Key takeaways for 2025

TypeScript best practices in 2025 reflect the language's maturity and the community's hard-won experience. Start with strict mode enabled, embrace unknown over any, leverage discriminated unions for complex types, and optimize performance through strategic use of interfaces. Choose type aliases for flexibility but interfaces for inheritance hierarchies.

Modern TypeScript is about more than just adding types to JavaScript—it's about leveraging a sophisticated type system to catch bugs at compile time, improve developer experience, and build more maintainable software. With the native compiler on the horizon and established best practices guiding development, TypeScript continues evolving from a JavaScript enhancement to an essential foundation for enterprise software development.

# Jest Testing Best Practices Guide 2025

Jest remains the dominant testing framework in the JavaScript ecosystem, though facing fierce competition from performance-focused alternatives like Vitest. With Jest 30 introducing breaking changes and the testing landscape evolving rapidly, this guide presents essential practices and modern patterns that help teams write reliable, maintainable tests while navigating the changing ecosystem.

## Test structure: Building maintainable test suites

Effective Jest tests start with clear, descriptive naming that creates a narrative when tests fail. The combination of filename, describe block, and test name should tell a complete story, enabling developers to understand failures without reading implementation code. This seemingly simple practice dramatically reduces debugging time in large test suites.

```javascript
// ✅ Clear test hierarchy with descriptive names
describe('ShoppingCart', () => {
  describe('when adding items', () => {
    it('increases the total price by the item cost', () => {
      const cart = new ShoppingCart();
      cart.addItem({ price: 10.99, quantity: 2 });

      expect(cart.totalPrice).toBe(21.98);
    });

    it('throws InvalidItem error when item lacks required price', () => {
      const cart = new ShoppingCart();

      expect(() => cart.addItem({ quantity: 1 }))
        .toThrow(InvalidItem);
    });
  });
});
```

**The AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern** provides consistent structure across all tests. This pattern keeps tests focused and readable by clearly separating setup, execution, and verification phases. Avoid the temptation to extract these phases into helper functions—keeping the logic within each test improves clarity and reduces cognitive load when debugging failures.

```javascript
it('processes payment and updates order status', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const order = createOrder({ total: 99.99 });
  const paymentService = createMockPaymentService();

  // Act
  const result = await processPayment(order, paymentService);

  // Assert
  expect(result.status).toBe('completed');
  expect(paymentService.charge).toHaveBeenCalledWith(99.99);
});
```

**Setup and teardown hooks** require careful consideration of scope and execution order. Jest executes hooks in a specific sequence that impacts test isolation. Understanding this order prevents subtle test interdependencies that cause flaky tests.

```javascript
describe('Database operations', () => {
  // Runs once before all tests in this describe block
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await database.connect();
  });

  // Runs before each test, ensuring clean state
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await database.seed(testData);
  });

  // Cleanup after each test
  afterEach(async () => {
    await database.clear();
  });

  // Final cleanup after all tests complete
  afterAll(async () => {
    await database.disconnect();
  });

  // Tests run with predictable database state
  it('finds users by email', async () => {
    const user = await database.findUserByEmail('test@example.com');
    expect(user).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## Mocking strategies: Balancing isolation and realism

Jest's mocking capabilities are powerful but easily misused. The key insight: **mock external dependencies, not internal implementation**. Over-mocking creates brittle tests that break with refactoring, while under-mocking leads to slow, flaky tests dependent on external services.

```javascript
// ✅ Mock external dependencies
jest.mock('../services/email');
jest.mock('../services/payment');

// ❌ Don't mock internal modules you're testing
// This creates tests that break with any refactoring

// ✅ Use dependency injection for cleaner mocking
const createOrderService = ({ emailService, paymentService }) => ({
  async processOrder(orderData) {
    const order = await validateOrder(orderData);
    const payment = await paymentService.charge(order.total);
    await emailService.sendConfirmation(order.customerEmail);
    return { order, payment };
  }
});

// In tests, inject mocks
it('processes order with mocked services', async () => {
  const emailMock = { sendConfirmation: jest.fn() };
  const paymentMock = { charge: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 'pay_123' }) };

  const orderService = createOrderService({
    emailService: emailMock,
    paymentService: paymentMock
  });

  const result = await orderService.processOrder(validOrderData);

  expect(paymentMock.charge).toHaveBeenCalledWith(99.99);
  expect(emailMock.sendConfirmation).toHaveBeenCalledWith('customer@example.com');
});
```

**Manual mocks** provide reusable test doubles for complex modules. Place them in `__mocks__` directories adjacent to the modules they mock, creating a centralized location for shared mock implementations.

```javascript
// __mocks__/fs.js
const fs = jest.createMockFromModule('fs');

const mockFiles = {};

fs.__setMockFiles = (files) => {
  Object.assign(mockFiles, files);
};

fs.readFileSync = (path) => mockFiles[path] || null;

module.exports = fs;
```

## Performance optimization: Speed at scale

Jest's default configuration often proves suboptimal for real-world projects. **Research shows 12-21% performance improvements** simply by tuning worker configuration. The key is matching worker count to your specific hardware and test characteristics.

```javascript
// package.json - Optimized test scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --maxWorkers=50%",          // Development: balanced performance
    "test:watch": "jest --watch --maxWorkers=25%", // Watch mode: responsive UI
    "test:ci": "jest --runInBand --coverage"   // CI: often faster in-band
  }
}
```

**Modern Jest configuration for 2025** emphasizes TypeScript support, ESM compatibility, and performance optimization:

```javascript
/** @type {import('jest').Config} */
module.exports = {
  // Modern environment setup
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  extensionsToTreatAsEsm: ['.ts', '.tsx'],

  // Performance optimizations
  maxWorkers: '50%',
  workerIdleMemoryLimit: '512MB',
  cache: true,
  cacheDirectory: '<rootDir>/.cache/jest',

  // TypeScript and ESM support
  preset: 'ts-jest/presets/default-esm',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': ['ts-jest', {
      useESM: true,
      tsconfig: {
        module: 'ES2022',
        target: 'ESNext'
      }
    }]
  },

  // Coverage configuration
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
    '!src/**/index.{js,ts}'
  ],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    }
  },

  // Module resolution
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
    '\\.(css|less|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy'
  },

  // Test isolation
  clearMocks: true,
  restoreMocks: true,
  resetModules: false  // Avoid expensive module resets
};
```

For large codebases exceeding 10,000 tests, implement **test sharding** across CI runners and monitor execution time trends. Facebook's optimizations—including slowest-first scheduling and inline requires—provide blueprints for extreme scale.

## Configuration best practices: Setting up for success

Jest configuration in 2025 requires careful balance between modern JavaScript features and performance. The ecosystem's shift toward ESM modules creates complexity but enables better tree-shaking and faster builds.

**Essential setup files** configure global test utilities and polyfills:

```javascript
// setupTests.js
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';

// Suppress console noise in tests
global.console = {
  ...console,
  log: jest.fn(),
  error: jest.fn(),
  warn: jest.fn()
};

// Mock browser APIs not available in test environment
Object.defineProperty(window, 'matchMedia', {
  writable: true,
  value: jest.fn().mockImplementation(query => ({
    matches: false,
    media: query,
    addEventListener: jest.fn(),
    removeEventListener: jest.fn()
  }))
});

// Add custom matchers
expect.extend({
  toBeWithinRange(received, floor, ceiling) {
    const pass = received >= floor && received <= ceiling;
    return {
      pass,
      message: () => pass
        ? `expected ${received} not to be within range ${floor} - ${ceiling}`
        : `expected ${received} to be within range ${floor} - ${ceiling}`
    };
  }
});
```

## Jest-specific features: Advanced patterns

**Custom matchers** transform domain-specific assertions into readable, reusable tests. Well-designed matchers improve test expressiveness while reducing boilerplate.

```javascript
// Custom matchers for domain objects
expect.extend({
  toBeValidUser(received) {
    const requiredFields = ['id', 'email', 'name'];
    const hasAllFields = requiredFields.every(field =>
      received.hasOwnProperty(field)
    );

    const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
    const hasValidEmail = emailRegex.test(received.email);

    return {
      pass: hasAllFields && hasValidEmail,
      message: () => hasAllFields
        ? `expected email "${received.email}" to be invalid`
        : `expected user to have required fields: ${requiredFields.join(', ')}`
    };
  }
});

// Usage
test('creates valid user object', () => {
  const user = createUser({ name: 'Jane', email: 'jane@example.com' });
  expect(user).toBeValidUser();
});
```

**Snapshot testing has fallen from grace**. Industry experts now recommend avoiding snapshots except for specific use cases like API response structures or configuration objects. The primary issues: snapshots validate current output rather than correct output, create maintenance burden, and often get blindly updated when they fail.

```javascript
// ❌ Avoid: Component snapshot testing
expect(component).toMatchSnapshot();

// ✅ Preferred: Explicit assertions
expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Submit');
expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeEnabled();

// ✅ Acceptable: API response structure
expect(apiResponse).toMatchSnapshot({
  id: expect.any(String),
  timestamp: expect.any(Number),
  // Only snapshot stable fields
});
```

## Modern testing patterns: Beyond unit tests

The testing pyramid has evolved into a **testing trophy** shape, with integration tests providing the best return on investment. Modern applications benefit from this distribution:
- **40% Unit tests**: Business logic, utilities, pure functions
- **40% Integration tests**: Component interactions, API integrations
- **20% E2E tests**: Critical user journeys

Integration tests catch real bugs while maintaining reasonable execution speed:

```javascript
// Integration test example
test('user can complete checkout flow', async () => {
  // Setup: render full app with providers
  const { user } = render(<App />, {
    wrapper: ({ children }) => (
      <AuthProvider>
        <CartProvider>
          {children}
        </CartProvider>
      </AuthProvider>
    )
  });

  // Add item to cart
  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /add to cart/i }));
  expect(screen.getByText('1 item in cart')).toBeInTheDocument();

  // Navigate to checkout
  await user.click(screen.getByRole('link', { name: /checkout/i }));

  // Complete purchase
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText(/email/i), 'customer@example.com');
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText(/card number/i), '4242424242424242');
  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /complete purchase/i }));

  // Verify success
  expect(await screen.findByText(/order confirmed/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(screen.getByText(/order #/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**React Testing Library's philosophy**—test user behavior, not implementation—has become the standard across frameworks. Query elements by their accessible roles, avoid testing internal state, and write tests that survive refactoring.

```javascript
// ✅ Test user-observable behavior
test('disables submit button while form is submitting', async () => {
  render(<ContactForm />);

  const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /send message/i });
  const emailInput = screen.getByLabelText(/email/i);

  await userEvent.type(emailInput, 'user@example.com');
  await userEvent.click(submitButton);

  // Button disabled during submission
  expect(submitButton).toBeDisabled();

  // Re-enabled after completion
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(submitButton).toBeEnabled();
  });
});
```

## The competitive landscape: Jest vs Vitest

While Jest remains dominant, **Vitest has emerged as a serious competitor** offering 10-20x performance improvements for Vite-based projects. The key advantages:
- Native ESM support without configuration
- Hot Module Replacement for tests
- Built-in TypeScript/JSX support
- Browser mode as JSDOM alternative

For new projects using Vite, Vitest provides a superior developer experience. However, Jest's ecosystem, maturity, and enterprise adoption ensure its continued relevance, especially for React applications and established codebases.

## Looking forward: Testing in an AI-enhanced world

The testing landscape in 2025 is being transformed by AI tools that generate tests, suggest assertions, and identify missing coverage. These tools work particularly well with strongly-typed TypeScript code, using type information to generate more accurate tests.

Key trends shaping testing's future:
- **AI-powered test generation** reducing boilerplate
- **Intelligent test selection** based on code changes
- **Visual regression testing** replacing snapshot tests
- **Browser-based testing** for more realistic environments
- **Performance-first frameworks** challenging Jest's dominance

## Key recommendations for excellence

Successfully implementing Jest best practices requires balancing multiple concerns: test reliability, execution speed, maintainability, and developer experience. Start with optimized worker configuration for immediate performance gains. Structure tests using AAA pattern with descriptive names. Mock external dependencies while keeping internal implementation untouched. Replace snapshot tests with explicit assertions that validate behavior rather than output.

Modern Jest testing is about more than catching bugs—it's about building confidence in your codebase through tests that document behavior, survive refactoring, and execute quickly. Whether you stick with Jest or explore alternatives like Vitest, these patterns and practices provide the foundation for reliable, maintainable test suites that give teams confidence to ship quality software rapidly.

The future of testing lies not in choosing between unit and integration tests, but in finding the right balance for your specific context. Focus on tests that provide maximum confidence with minimum maintenance burden, leverage modern tools and patterns, and remember Kent C. Dodds' timeless advice: "The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you."
